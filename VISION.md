# Opportunity.ai Vision

## Mission

Opportunity.ai is an AI-assisted job search and application management platform designed to streamline every step of a tech professional's job hunt. Our core purpose is to help users discover relevant jobs across multiple countries, tailor their applications (CVs, cover letters) to each opportunity, and track their job pipeline – all in one compliant, efficient workflow.

## Vision Statement

The platform acts as a "job search copilot," combining job aggregation, AI-driven personalization, and organizational tools so candidates can focus on landing the right role rather than juggling dozens of tabs and documents.

## Problem Statement

Job searching in tech is often a fragmented and time-consuming process. Professionals scour various job boards (LinkedIn, company websites, Xing, etc.) to find openings, manually tweak their resumes and write new cover letters for each application, and struggle to keep track of where they applied and what the status is. Important opportunities can slip through the cracks without a centralized tracking system, and generic applications often fail to stand out to recruiters.

In a global job market, these challenges are amplified – candidates may be targeting roles in different countries and platforms, each with their own formats and expectations. Traditional tools like spreadsheets or one-off resume builders only address pieces of the process, leaving an integrated solution as a clear gap.
